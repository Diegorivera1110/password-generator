# password-generator


## Updated to HTML & CSS
Before writing any JavaScript, I first wanted to verify where the user could input their preferences
and so I added a "Checklist" that allowed the user to check off how long they would like their password
and If they wanted to include uppercase, lowercase, symbols, or special characters.
I then made sure to add to CSS so that these checklist elements stacked neatly.
